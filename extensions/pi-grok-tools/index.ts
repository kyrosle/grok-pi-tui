 * Applies the host's persisted grok-pi built-in-tool preference at session

 * `--exclude-tools` so those names are absent from the registry/getAllTools;
 * this extension then activates the selected names that are still registered.
 * Non-built-in extension/custom tool names remain untouched.
 *
 * CLI tool restrictions always take priority over F2 preferences:
 * - --no-tools / --no-builtin-tools: extension is not injected at all.
 * - --exclude-tools: PI_GROK_EXCLUDE_TOOLS carries the exclusion list;
 *   excluded builtins are removed from the F2-selected set.
 * - --tools / -t: extension is not injected (authoritative allowlist).
