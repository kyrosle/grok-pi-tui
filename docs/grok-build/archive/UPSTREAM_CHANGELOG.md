# Upstream Changelog

Changelog of upstream **Grok Build** (`xai-org/grok-build`) changes absorbed by
this fork (`Dwsy/grok-pi`). This is the **upstream update record**: it lists what
upstream changed and which features were affected, so each sync can be reviewed
before and after the merge.

> [!NOTE]
> Upstream commits are titled `Synced from monorepo` but each carries a full
> **`Changes:`** bullet list and a **`Source-Revision:`** trailer in its message
> body. Feature descriptions below are **transcribed from those commit messages**
> (the authoritative source). Diff analysis is used only to fill the Areas-touched
> statistics and to derive descriptions for the rare commit that lacks a
> `Changes:` list.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Entries are **newest first**. This file is maintained by the
historical upstream-changelog skill. This file is archived; current reviews use [grok-build-review](../../../.pi/skills/grok-build-review/SKILL.md).

## Entry schema

Each entry records:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Upstream tip | Full upstream commit SHA being synced to |
| Range | `FROM..TO` git range (`merge-base..upstream-tip`) |
| SOURCE_REV | Monorepo revision from the `Source-Revision:` trailer / `SOURCE_REV` file at the upstream tip |
| Date | Date the record was generated (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Stats | Files changed, insertions(+), deletions(−) |
| Added / Changed / Fixed | Feature bullets transcribed from upstream commit `Changes:` lists |
| Areas touched | Per-crate/area change statistics table (from `git diff --numstat`) |

## [2bdd1d6a] — 2026-10-02

> **Status:** Recorded before selective TUI absorption. No full upstream merge is claimed. Grok supplies native TUI; all functional semantics remain Pi-owned. Adopted groups and rejected backend changes are tracked in [Pi-first PLAN](../../issues/架构/20261002-pi-first-tui-PLAN.md).

- **Sync range:** `37949780..2bdd1d6a` (`37949780c144e37df692e3d669051a21fec24f20` → `2bdd1d6a6369de0e8c68132ea4539e9abd9e14a8`)
- **Upstream commits:** 7
- **Upstream SOURCE_REV:** `559751fdcec02d413e4c57c8832ab275e4f44980`; the fork's complete baseline stays `c4ea71cfdbcdb21e32e41bc25a0043d7d4836714`.
- **Diff size:** 2484 files changed, 335380 insertions(+), 101458 deletions(-)

### Summary

The pending range includes terminal restoration and keyboard fencing, clipboard/image delivery and repaint fixes, minimal layout/resize, model-picker and question-view changes, plus substantial stock Agent Host/Remote Control, workspace, permission, memory and MCP backend work. Only applicable native TUI groups and their necessary contracts will be adopted for grok-pi.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- Pager App/dispatch, terminal restoration, image lifecycle and model/session UI overlap the Pi external-profile seams. Import related native changes as a group, retaining Pi ownership of sessions, commands, queues and tools.
- Agent Host/Remote Control, stock memory, sampling, managed cloud config and Grok MCP client updates are backend changes; recording them does not adopt them.
- Selective adoption does not advance the complete SOURCE_REV/base. Verifier metadata is reviewed per exact changed file.


## [37949780] — 2026-09-12

> **Status:** Merged into `main` by `8541c842` on 2026-09-12; the original isolated integration branch was `merge/upstream-37949780`. This entry **supersedes the [9684fa3c] entry below**: that entry covered the first 3 commits of this same range; all 8 commits here were integrated together. Conflict resolution followed [`MERGE_ANALYSIS_37949780/REPORT.md`](../../upstream/MERGE_ANALYSIS_37949780/REPORT.md); the final index has 0 unresolved conflicts, `git diff --check` passes, and the manually merged Rust files pass `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check`. Cargo/build/test gates were intentionally not run in this integration session, so full verification is not claimed green; the existing verifier baseline blockers remain documented in [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](../../VERIFICATION.md) and no source-identity allowlist was broadened.

- **Sync range:** `07b2f714..37949780` (`07b2f7144fd5c5c9d3dd1966937a87852d2dbdb8` → `37949780c144e37df692e3d669051a21fec24f20`)
- **Upstream commits:** 8 (`Synced from monorepo`)
- **SOURCE_REV (monorepo SHA):** `c4ea71cfdbcdb21e32e41bc25a0043d7d4836714` (was `956313d459bee15ae8f17bf73e0633605e18dddd`)
- **Diff size:** 2998 files changed, +341620 / −228519 (rename-aware: 454 added, 90 deleted, 2454 modified)

### Summary

The largest sync recorded so far — eight monorepo syncs and ~3k files. Headlines: an isolated, durable **v2 memory** system; an **agent-host daemon** that can run full turns (Ctrl-C stop, picker resume, multi-folder workspaced daemon); a **startup-latency overhaul** (startup spans and sub-phase timers, a single settings fetch per boot, cache-first `/settings`, transport/auth/sampling prewarm); a much larger **MCP** surface (2026-07-28 elicitation, bind-time servers, a managed MCP/plugin/marketplace policy engine); the gated Pager **panel dock** and a queue/turn-UX pass; and **four security fixes** (GROK_CHANNEL RCE, symlink deny-rule bypass, sandboxed SessionStart hook escape, installer token leak). Two big additions dominate line counts: the new `xai-grok-login` crate (+26.7k gross, auth/login rework) and generated bot-relay Swift/Kotlin bindings in ACP/protocol (+15.5k). For grok-pi this is the highest-risk sync on record: **310 files changed on both fork and upstream sides** (245 of them in `xai-grok-pager`), versus 110 in the last entry.

### Added

- **v2 memory system:** isolated v2 memory storage foundation, a safe v2 memory file workflow, durable v2 memory observation capture, and a documented isolated memory filesystem contract.
- **Agent-host daemon:** run a full turn on the agent-host daemon; stop it with Ctrl-C; resume an agent-host session from the picker; answer `session/new` at spawn; add a multi-folder grok-workspaced daemon alongside the supervised sidecar. Documents cover agent-host prompt/load, the workspaced control socket, and the TUI worker + Esc cancel.
- **Workflow control:** pause and stop sources so the agent can control its own workflow runs.
- **MCP:** MCP 2026-07-28 elicitation via multi round-trip requests; bind-time MCP servers; a managed MCP, plugin, and marketplace policy engine; ACP `session/set_config_option` support (documented together with the 1h get-output wait cap).
- **New crates:** `xai-grok-login` (auth/login subsystem), `xai-grok-feedback` (structured feedback envelope with typed source; feedback draft-store lock retry before reporting Busy; submission/draft metrics), `xai-grok-otel`, `xai-grok-image`, `xai-message-delivery-core`, `xai-interjection-core`, and the gboom game extracted into standalone `xai-grok-gboom`.
- **Panel dock (gated):** consolidated Subagents/Tasks/Watchers/Queued above the prompt.
- **Dashboard chrome:** unified header and actions row; extracted header/actions-row chrome and location helpers; walk the actions row with ←/→ and let Enter act like a click.
- **Observability:** export turn time-to-first-token and time-to-first-message as OpenTelemetry histograms; startup spans for session create, spawn, prefetch, git scan, replay, and bootstrap, with startup sub-phase timing in the startup-complete event; session-create sub-phase timers; report TUI startup at the first interactive frame; answer the client before the skills scan with a startup-timing breakdown; shell span profiler; measure session start/resume latency, cancel-to-stop latency, and pager-busy input wait; fleet observability for turn-level transient retries; instrument the worktree lifecycle; measure session-end teardown as tracing spans; measure startup in CI across repo sizes.
- **Scheduler / background tasks:** scheduler wakeups ask to fix, delete, or update the scheduled task; emit a durable background-tasks list snapshot; open the background-task viewer from the jump control even without a scrollback anchor; `scheduler_create` documents when to use the tool.
- **Models:** unify the model-behavior schema and resolver; pin selectable models from signed `requirements.toml`; offer effort level as a setting instead of many model variants; let a model name a different id for each effort.
- **Subagent attempts:** give subagent activations an attempt id and track subagent lifecycle per attempt; active subagent follow-up messaging (`send_subagent_message`); subagent completion notices include the command or subagent output.
- **Hooks:** client-registered PostToolUse hooks contribute feedback and context; parse PreToolUse `additionalContext` and defer; PreToolUse `ask` prompts the user.
- **Bot relay / computer hub:** bot-client connection kind, bot-relay wire types, and a computer-hub upstream connection manager; typed workspace-server metadata and `ServerInfo` last-seen timestamp; allowlist listener connect commands, `setAgentNotificationsEnabled`, and avatar commands; advertise bot tool argument schemas.
- **Voice:** insert CLI/TUI voice dictation at the cursor position.
- **Live user-message echo** opt-in via client capabilities.
- **Queue:** hold queued follow-ups through waits; add a parent Queue delivery base; share ordinary human message admission.
- **Headless:** headless session resume page; the shell classifies headless sessions.
- **Distribution:** ship the install download compressed (zstd/gzip); compress Windows CLI builds with zstd/gzip sidecars.
- **Worktree/clone:** fail-closed shallow clone protocol; `grok clone` bootstrap depth one; reuse a linked or local codebase for session worktrees/clone; cross-transport worktree lifecycle sampler/bench.
- **Auth/identity:** auth decisions route through an `AuthBackend` trait; chat/gateway identity stamp and runtime rehydration from the chat store.
- **Sampler salvage** of length-truncated responses behind a per-request length policy.
- **Workflow smoke-check** for authored Rhai files.
- **Docs:** the isolated memory filesystem contract; the folder-trust startup gate and scheduler wakeup footer; agent-host surfaces (above).

### Changed

- **Compaction:** default to two-pass mode; chat compaction mode defaults to segments; forward `/compact` instructions to compaction; re-inject scheduled loops and live workflows on compaction; route 413 and drifted size-overflow errors through the compaction input ladder; surface the real compaction error instead of a bare "Compaction failed."; control length salvage with a remote setting; handle split `max_prompt_tokens`/`max_time_limit` incomplete reasons and carry `raw_stop_reason`; execute completed tool calls on Length-truncated turns instead of failing; route truncation failures to the truncation error copy via a typed error kind.
- **Permissions / trust:** Auto mode uses a fail-closed allowlist for routine git operations; reject `ripgrep --hostname-bin` on always-safe and Auto routine paths; auto-allow `mkdir`/`touch` as safe creation; reduce auto-mode friction while hardening always-allow scoping; make the interactive default permission mode configurable (Auto reverted as default); prompt when the classifier blocks on interactive clients; allow agent messages in Auto mode; default headless sessions to always-allow so they never wedge on prompts; gate project instructions, skills, untrusted project-agent `mcpServers`, and directory-typed vendor hook settings paths on folder trust; trusting a parent directory no longer implicitly trusts repos cloned under it later.
- **Hooks enforcement:** run the prompt gate before the chat-state commit; parse and enforce `UserPromptSubmit` block decisions and hold the queue behind a blocked prompt; managed-policy hooks cannot be disabled; hooks UI is silent on success, shows a status row while a hook blocks the turn, and one line on failure; bound session-close hooks with a per-hook budget; hooks modal gains a source-level removable flag and non-empty group-collapse seeding.
- **Queue / turn UX:** Esc no longer cancels a running turn — it hints at Ctrl+C; stop an agent-host turn with Ctrl-C; restore Send now during auto-wake and drop the fake cancel when sending during one; paint `[edit]` between `[Send now]` and `[cancel]` and shorten the comment to 3 lines; hold the client-owned local queue after a hook-blocked turn; keep the status row stable across send-now; keep a running command alive when you send a message; gate monitor-event wakes on the session's own turn flag; advertise the 15-second auto-background wait, not the 120-second timeout; cap get-output waits at 1 hour.
- **Subagent coordination:** steer owned subagents at the next safe point; wake the same agent when a send hits a finished subagent; the wake turn delivers one digest for every finished subagent and drops its own completion; always shut down completed subagent sessions even when the parent actor is busy; wait for a spawning child before send fails; wake task waits on child exit; reopen subagent spawn admission before `/goal` slash intercepts; keep remote settings readable after a subagent spawn; gate concurrent subagent sampling to avoid proxy rate-limit bursts; move subagent attempt minting and wake glue to the crates that own them.
- **Startup latency:** fetch startup settings once per boot with a single owner; cache-first `/settings` so a warm boot skips the network; move managed config off the startup critical path; prefetch repo status; warm the shared HTTP client; prewarm the sampling transport at session create and the auth refresh at agent spawn; replace the turn-end usage drain poll with a coordinator notification; batch safe-point chat insertion; compress the bundled ripgrep.
- **MCP:** consolidate MCP startup ownership; move MCP OAuth off the session spawn path; start MCP servers without a batch cap; announce server failures once per episode; detach the serve loop from the turn trace.
- **Auth:** park credential-less 401s on the uncharged resubmit path when auth recovery is deferred; resolve the reasoning-effort selector under the config lock; a single home resolver so Windows agents can open `~/.grok`; parse workspace `config.toml` as a document for the local auto-GC opt-in.
- **Session lifecycle:** decouple session and extensions; separate the turn task from cancellation; count active workflows in session liveness; arbitrate turn finalization and bind completion to the exact turn epoch; stop a dropped connection costing a subagent 2s; don't cancel live parent-message turns; resume when the transcript fits the window; fail safe when the agent never acknowledges a prompt; remind the model when a session is forked; defer exit dream off the session-close path.
- **Skills:** skill rescan announces only unannounced names and skips identical listings; refresh the session skill baseline when `/skills` lists skills.
- **Pager surfaces:** jump turns with Shift+J/K like the timeline; keep user-expanded Execute panels open while progress updates; preserve startup Enter chords; quieter next-prompt ghost text; draw the minimal-mode reasoning rail under the diamond and the status line row in minimal mode; remove the scrollback accent rail on collapsed rows; keep the full URL on every wrapped line of a bare URL in a table cell; ellipsize lone overlong slash command names; tip `/copy` and `/export` after repeated select+scroll; double-click selects settings radios; match dock hover background to the terminal row hover; left-align the dock task spinner and drop the header rule; paint `[stop]` on every dock row; match theme aliases in the `/theme` picker; anchor `edit_file` diffs to real file line numbers; close the workflow modal on X instead of popping the list; render failed suppressed tool calls instead of dropping them; persist per-turn usage and expose it via `grok usage`; reassemble relay-mangled X10 mouse reports instead of typing them as text; do not auto-send a paste that ends in a newline; skip unchanged Kitty overlay frames on Warp; show humanized errors on retry status; show full UI output in bash mode; ensure shell history contains commands.
- **Telemetry:** honour `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` for product telemetry and keep test/dev-build telemetry off production destinations; include the model in tool telemetry; record content-free Steer telemetry; hold the stream span open to first token with interior segments; detach turn-end uploads from the `agent.prompt` span and adopt its traceparent on `session.handle_prompt`; instrument post-turn work; parent instrumentation timer spans so profiler children nest; persist `elapsed_ms` on turn completed; emit startup phases as tracing spans; emit session-start context occupancy metrics; restore `session.id` (plus cost and cache-creation) on external OTEL work events; record prompt-suggestion fetch outcomes, request ids, remote knobs, and a session-model default; improve compaction telemetry.
- **Models:** retarget legacy model slugs to grok-4.6.
- **Memory:** treat recalled memory context as advisory; ground durable memory summaries in reusable facts; build the memory archive off the session runtime.
- **Dashboard:** adopt live sessions into the dashboard workspace; read workspace members in dashboard v2.
- **Sandbox:** canonicalize socket masks and require bubblewrap on Devbox; block the io_uring child-network bypass; gate the bubblewrap lockdown helper on enforce mode; add a feature-flag switch for workspace OIDC proactive refresh.
- **Worktree:** remediate monitored job failures; heal untagged worktree summaries at list and load; stamp worktree identity on summaries at creation; use the create/fork Grove gate on new-worktree resume; retry transient sampler failures instead of killing the turn.
- **Structure:** unify websocket crates on 0.28 to drop a duplicate TUI stack; collapse slash-command static metadata into a `slash_meta!` macro; move pager `input/` and `search/` into `xai-grok-pager-render`; give the model catalog one source for its URL and its fetch; voice falls back from unusable pw-record on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).
- **Misc:** report bypass lock as advisory in `grok inspect`; hide the workflow tool from child agents; enforce exclusive source selection for workflows; route session picker results to the requesting picker; stop print-once from freezing streaming wake-turn replies at their first chunk; stop the project discovery watcher from re-advertising on grok home writes; sanitize and quote remote text in the failed-server reminder; inspect advisory follow-ups with a named policy result, pin reason enum, and a single pin read; hub/terminal reports workspace boundness explicitly instead of counting tools.

### Fixed

- **Security:** persistent RCE via unescaped `GROK_CHANNEL` interpolated into `~/.grok/config.toml`; native Write/Edit bypass of deny rules via repository symlink; SessionStart hook persistence via `config.toml` in the sandbox leading to unsandboxed execution; the installer no longer sends the deployment key as a Bearer token to an attacker-settable URL.
- Scheduler keeps dashes in loop task UUIDs, preserves full task UUIDs, and stops completed recurring tasks.
- Fix startup cache and settings loading; fix `/resume` after a forgotten `--continue` so unused home husks are dropped.
- Fix the MCP OAuth deadlock on `/mcps` auth.
- Fix smart table highlighting inside `/btw`; stop SVG PNG thumbnails from poisoning conversation turns.
- Fix dock input bugs, row indent, and the dock feature flag; fix foreground terminal completion regressions; fix always-dirty rebuild inputs causing no-op rebuilds; unfreeze the extensions modal loading spinner.
- Deflake the cancel/resend PTY + graceful SIGTERM fixture; close the turn-1/turn-2 race in the autoscroll copy PTY test.
- Remediate monitored job failures; make acked flushes durable and renames tear-proof; cover finalization arbitration races.
- Raise the spawn validation timeout and stop treating a busy coordinator as unreachable.
- Send plugin document context as structured input.
- Don't panic when emitting a session telemetry event without a Tokio runtime.
- Clamp images to 2000px even when re-encode doesn't shrink bytes.
- Fix the `Path` import on Darwin enforce builds.
- Point the grok npm bin entry at the installed binary.
- Make a policy-leader reclaim not kill supervised daemons.
- Spawning a subagent is no longer treated as a plan-mode file edit.
- Speed up history jobs by avoiding full-tree checkouts.

### Removed / Deprecated

- Delete the never-wired worktree pool and relocation transaction machinery.
- Delete verified dead code in `xai-grok-pager` (wrapper layer, dashboard vestiges, dead helpers); purge stale internal docs, orphaned assets, and dead benchmark examples; remove unused dev binaries (`test-sampling-server`, `test_multipart_upload`).
- Remove duplicate tests in `xai-grok-shell` (no coverage loss) and dead/duplicate tests in scrollback and slash/acp/diagnostics/notifications.
- Relocations (not capability loss): pager `input/` + `search/` moved into `xai-grok-pager-render`; gboom game extracted into `xai-grok-gboom`; shell auth manager replaced by the new `xai-grok-login` crate.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- **Overlap tripled:** 310 files changed on both the fork and upstream sides since `07b2f714` — 245 in `xai-grok-pager` (fork seams live in `app/` dispatch, `event_loop.rs`, `agent_view`, `views/dock`, and modals), 25 in `xai-grok-shell`, 8 in `xai-grok-pager-render`, 6 in `xai-grok-workspace` (permission manager), 4 in `xai-grok-tools`. The last sync overlapped 110 files.
- New crates (`xai-grok-login`, `xai-grok-feedback`, `xai-grok-otel`, `xai-grok-image`, `xai-grok-gboom`, `xai-message-delivery-core`) don't conflict; ACP/protocol +20.9k is mostly generated bot-relay Swift/Kotlin bindings.
- The pager `input/`+`search/` move into `xai-grok-pager-render` and the `slash_meta!` collapse will relocate fork seam anchors — the source-identity verifier's allowed-seam baselines need deliberate updates after the merge.
- `SOURCE_REV`, `AGENTS.md` `base`, and verifier baselines change only after a completed, verified merge.

## [9684fa3c] — 2026-08-28

> **Status:** Pending — not yet merged into grok-pi. **Superseded by the [37949780] entry above**, which covers this same still-pending range (`07b2f714..9684fa3c`) extended to the newer upstream tip.

- **Diff size:** 665 files changed, +63210 / −8705

### Summary

Three monorepo syncs land bot-relay/computer-hub, subagent follow-up messaging, hook prompt-gating, dashboard live-session adoption, worktree shallow-clone/lifecycle tooling, and a large permission/trust/sandbox hardening pass. Pager and Shell still dominate the diff; protocol generated bindings for bot-relay inflate ACP line counts. For grok-pi the merge is high-risk because 110 files changed on both sides, concentrated on Pager `app/` dispatch, session, event_loop, queue, dashboard, ACP tracker, config paths, folder trust, and subagent spawn — even though a static `merge-tree` preview auto-merged those files with no conflict markers.

### Added

- Headless session resume page; shell classifies headless sessions.
- Bot-client role, bot-relay skeleton/wire types, and a computer-hub upstream connection manager for bot relay.
- Fail-closed shallow clone protocol; `grok clone` bootstrap depth one; reuse a linked or local codebase for session worktrees / clone.
- Active subagent follow-up messaging (`send_subagent_message`).
- Workflow smoke-check for authored Rhai files.
- Cross-transport worktree lifecycle sampler/bench.
- Shell span profiler; session-start context occupancy; startup CI measurement across repo sizes; cancel/input-wait/session start-resume latency; persist `elapsed_ms` on turn completed.
- Sampler salvage of length-truncated responses behind a per-request length policy.
- Auth decisions route through an `AuthBackend` trait.
- Hooks parse `UserPromptSubmit` block decisions.
- Chat/gateway identity stamp and runtime rehydration from the chat store.
- Typed workspace-server metadata and `ServerInfo` last-seen timestamp.
- Interactive default permission mode is configurable.
- Sandbox feature-flag for workspace OIDC proactive refresh.
- Dashboard store crate for live-session adoption and workspace members.

### Changed

- Compaction defaults to two-pass; chat compaction mode defaults to segments; recalled memory is advisory; durable memory summaries are grounded in reusable facts.
- Interactive permission reverts Auto as the default, then makes the default configurable; auto-mode friction drops while always-allow scoping hardens; `mkdir`/`touch` auto-allow as safe creation; classifier blocks prompt on interactive clients; Auto mode allows agent messages.
- Headless sessions default permission mode to always-allow so they never wedge on prompts.
- Concurrent subagent sampling is gated to avoid proxy 429 bursts.
- Workflow tool is hidden from child agents; workflow source selection is exclusive.
- A running command stays alive when you send a message; history jobs avoid full-tree checkouts.
- Status line is drawn in minimal mode; collapsed rows lose the scrollback accent rail.
- TUI retargets legacy model slugs to grok-4.6.
- Websocket crates unify on 0.28 to drop a duplicate TUI stack.
- Hooks run the prompt gate before the chat-state commit; `UserPromptSubmit` blocks hold the client-owned local queue; managed-policy hooks cannot be disabled.
- MCP announces server failures once per episode; untrusted project-agent `mcpServers` are gated on folder trust; the serve loop detaches from the turn trace.
- Bubblewrap lockdown helper is gated on enforce mode; sandbox canonicalizes socket masks and requires bubblewrap on Devbox.
- Dashboard adopts live sessions into the dashboard workspace and reads workspace members in v2.
- Tracing emits startup phases as spans, detaches turn-end uploads from `agent.prompt`, adopts `agent.prompt` traceparent on `session.handle_prompt`, and instruments post-turn work.
- Hub/terminal reports workspace boundness explicitly instead of counting tools.
- `scheduler_create` documents when to use the tool.

### Fixed

- Spawning a subagent is no longer treated as a plan-mode file edit.
- Relay-mangled X10 mouse reports are reassembled instead of typed as text.
- Trusting a parent directory no longer implicitly trusts every repo cloned under it later.
- Remote text in the failed-server reminder is sanitized and quoted.
- Session picker results route to the requesting picker.
- Print-once no longer freezes streaming wake-turn replies at their first chunk.
- Shell history contains commands; user-expanded Execute panels stay open while progress updates.
- Task waits wake on child exit.
- Pager always-dirty rebuild inputs, turn-end markers on resume, paste-ending-in-newline auto-send, unchanged Kitty overlay frames on Warp, and the autoscroll copy PTY turn-1/turn-2 race.
- Sandbox Darwin `Path` import on enforce builds; io_uring child-network bypass is blocked.
- Voice falls back from unusable `pw-record` on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04).
- Installer no longer sends the deployment key as a Bearer token to an attacker-settable URL.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- 110 files changed on both sides. A static `git merge-tree` preview auto-merged them with **0 conflict markers**, so textual merge may look clean while semantic seam conflicts remain.
- Hottest overlap is Pager `app/` (82 upstream files in this range): `dispatch/` (27), session (16), `event_loop` (3), queue (5), dashboard (3), plus ACP tracker, session picker, and scrollback.
- Product-isolation hotspot: `xai-grok-config/src/paths.rs` and workspace `folder_trust` / permission resolution.
- Subagent spawn (`xai-grok-shell` ACP session spawn + tools `send_subagent_message`) overlaps grok-pi's child-session / TasksPane path.
- Additive surfaces (bot-relay, dashboard-store, worktree bench) are lower conflict but still need native-Pager mapping, not a second TUI.
- Do not update `SOURCE_REV`, `AGENTS.md` base, or verifier baselines until a completed, verified merge.

- **Diff size:** 1002 files changed, +110382 / −26245

### Summary

Eight monorepo syncs substantially rework Pager, Shell, worktree, workflow, MCP, permission, auth and subagent behavior. The largest grok-pi opportunities are in-process screen-mode switching, workflow/subagent concurrency improvements, MCP elicitation, prompt stash, status-line work, projected worktrees and reliability hardening. The merge is high risk for the fork because 173 files changed on both sides and a static three-way preview reports 49 conflicts, concentrated exactly on Pager app/dispatch/workflow/screen-mode and product-isolation seams.

### Areas touched

### Added

- Grok 4.6 becomes the bundled default model and model catalogs can carry `model_family`.
- `GROK_CONFIG` / `GROK_CONFIG_PATH` can override the config location.
- Consent notices can gate sessions, propagate from remote settings, and be recorded server-side.
- Automatic worktree garbage collection uses a fail-closed safety gate; projected-worktree cloning is supported.
- MCP elicitation gains a human-in-the-loop popup and protocol icons; `mcp add` infers HTTP transport for http(s) URLs.
- Workflows gain remote-bundle discovery, autocomplete, child effort and `agent_budget`; plugin-provided agents appear in `/agents`.
- Pager gains in-process `/minimal` ↔ `/fullscreen` switching, Ctrl+S prompt stash/restore, periodic status-line refresh and queue-focused Up navigation.
- Telemetry adds process CPU/memory snapshots, heap/tool-result size, prompt timing/retry/output-token fields and compaction mode/two-pass timing.
- Feedback supports image attachments end-to-end.
- App builder gains `init_or_update_app`; Grok Build config-file reference docs are generated.

### Changed

- Reasoning effort is passed via `_meta.reasoningEffort` on session/new and session/load.
- Managed MCP matching is keyed and hardened by server name; stdio MCP startup no longer blocks session startup.
- Pre-session permission mode is applied; interactive TUI soft-defaults to Auto and remember-tool-approvals defaults on.
- Typed memory configuration, typed input provenance/queue policy, and canonical shell attempt records replace looser compatibility paths.
- Queued messages can interject immediately; goal mode no longer blocks queued messages/edits.
- Subagents drop spawn-time `capability_mode`, avoid parent-session serialization, defer transcript replay, retry proxy 429 bursts and memoize tool schemas under fan-out.
- `/copy` uses source Markdown; slash menu ordering, `/plugin` alias and expanded `/edit-prompt` update command UX.
- TLS trust/custom CA handling is consolidated across HTTPS/WebSocket clients and the OS trust store is read once per process.
- Authentication startup/refresh lock handling is bounded and stale auth locks are recovered in place.
- Doom-loop handling is expanded, including higher thresholds and guided sampler retries.

### Fixed

- Filesystem operations resolve against the bound session working directory and Grok home resolution is corrected on Windows.
- Plan-mode prompt drafts survive approval; queued-row commands and hook stop/update notifications are preserved.
- List-pane empty rebuild scrolling no longer panics; `grok inspect` handles closed stdout pipes.
- Still-streaming replies no longer freeze when thinking interleaves.
- Session HEAD metadata resolves from refs only, never by probing the object database.
- Imagine/video zero-data-retention storage messaging/errors are corrected.
- Sibling worktree registrations are preserved when removing a worktree.
- Identical tool-call loops are interrupted earlier in two tiers.
- Invalid certificate classification and WebSocket ALPN handling are corrected.
- Stale MCP `init_failed` records clear on config updates; stale same-server computer-hub registrations are superseded.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- Static `git merge-tree --write-tree HEAD upstream/main` predicts **49 conflicts** and **173 files modified on both sides**.
- Highest-risk Pager seams: `app/acp_handler`, `app/agent_view`, `app/dispatch`, `app/event_loop.rs`, `app/effects`, `slash/commands/screen_mode_switch.rs`, `slash/commands/workflow.rs`, dashboard/settings/session views and PTY mode-switch tests.
- Product isolation conflicts directly in `xai-grok-config/src/paths.rs`; preserve `$GROK_HOME` / `~/.grok-pi` and project `.grok-pi` routing.
- Workflow conflicts reach `xai-grok-shell/src/session/workflow/host_service.rs`; grok-pi must keep `ExternalWorkflowRuntime` with Pi spawning and must not transfer agent/session ownership back to stock Grok Shell.
- Upstream does **not** directly modify `pi-grok-adapter` or the `grok-pi.rs`/`grok_pi/` composition entry, so those should remain narrow seams rather than targets for structural rewrites.
- The upstream in-process `/minimal` ↔ `/fullscreen` design is desirable only if the external-profile process and Pi argv/session remain intact; existing fork behavior deliberately excluded the old re-exec implementation for that reason.


## [e5fd481] — 2026-08-13

> **Status:** Merged — integrated on `sync/upstream-e5fd481` as merge commit `300a6539`, on top of the delivered `75e73f3` sync. Cargo-verified this time: `./build.sh`, `pi-grok-adapter` (160 passed), and `grok-pi` bin tests (75 passed) are green. `xai-grok-pager --lib` compiles for the first time since `a5589e9` (pre-sync `main` failed to build that target at all) and reports 8722 passed / 52 failed; those 52 have no pre-sync baseline and are still to be triaged.

- **Sync range:** `75e73f3..e5fd481` (`75e73f3d6ac0350d211f12ae7d57c2c0aad72576` → `e5fd4816d43260c15ba785f103990c1ed6cea230`)
- **Upstream commits:** 3 (`Synced from monorepo`)
- **SOURCE_REV (monorepo SHA):** `ea094a8c369475f97c85540d01730baec0dce5d6` (was `a61c32b12a2b400f212221cd8762e05f9b36828d`)
- **Diff size:** 643 files changed, +148800 / −110648

### Summary

Three monorepo syncs land a live presence protocol, a `/rename` overhaul, and a
large round of subagent, permission, image, and cancellation hardening. Shell
and Pager together account for the bulk of the diff, with Workspace/Permission
third; the biggest new surfaces are workspace bindings (`EnsureBinding`,
`MergeToMain`, `Push`), `GROK_SESSION_ID` propagation into tool commands and MCP
servers, and MCP protocol version `2025-11-25`. For grok-pi the sensitive part
is not the feature list but the location: subagent stop/cancel, queue promote,
composer paste/type-ahead, and dashboard shortcuts all sit on Pi-owned seams.

This entry starts at `75e73f3` rather than `a5589e9` because the earlier
`a5589e9..75e73f3` range was already recorded and integrated on
`sync/upstream-75e73f3`, which is being delivered as the base of this sync.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

Static three-way preview (`git merge-tree --write-tree`) against the delivery
base predicts **22 conflicted files** — 21 content conflicts plus one
modify/delete (`tests/pty_e2e_shell_tools.rs`, deleted locally, modified
upstream). Hotspots, in seam order:

- **Pager app root and dispatch:** `app/actions.rs`, `app/app_view.rs`,
  `app/event_loop.rs`, `app/effects/mod.rs`, `app/dispatch/router.rs`,
  `app/dispatch/session/modal.rs`, `app/agent_view/input.rs`. These carry the
  freshly added `Action::OpenPiSettings` seam, so resolution must keep both the
  upstream action surface and the grok-pi settings entry point.
- **ACP mirror:** `acp/model_state.rs`, `acp/tracker.rs` — upstream's
  catalog-refresh model retention meets the adapter-driven model state.
- **Views:** `views/dashboard/{render,state}.rs`, `views/block_viewer.rs`,
  `views/shortcuts_help.rs` — Ctrl+4, subagent stop, and shortcut listings.
- **Selection/scrollback:** `scrollback/state/selection.rs`,
  `scrollback/blocks/tool/edit.rs` — soft-wrap word selection.
- **Shell/workspace:** `shell-base/util/grok_home.rs` (product state isolation
  — must keep `$GROK_HOME` → `~/.grok-pi`), `session/acp_session_impl/laziness_classifier.rs`,
  `workspace-types/src/rpc/workspace.rs` (new binding operations).

Upstream's `views/settings_modal` is untouched by grok-pi, so the new
`views/pi_settings` panel adds no conflict there; the risk is concentrated in
the action/router/modal wiring instead.

## [75e73f3] — 2026-08-10

> **Status:** Merged — integrated on `sync/upstream-75e73f3` as merge commit `dc690ac2139cd62bf7c44400da704e3dc5ff52b9`; validation was static-only (no Cargo).

- **Sync range:** `a5589e9..75e73f3` (`a5589e958437d79e13db026eedcb1720bffd4063` → `75e73f3d6ac0350d211f12ae7d57c2c0aad72576`)

- **Diff size:** 406 files changed, +36871 / -12418

### Summary

Pager/Shell lifecycle, rewind, usage UI, memory trace, worktree, MCP and task/subagent safety dominate this range. It overlaps 89 locally changed files and predicts 18 content conflicts, so integration stays isolated and preserves Pi-owned agent/session/queue semantics.

## [a5589e9] — 2026-08-07

- **Diff size:** 577 files changed, +44078 / −17588

### Summary

This four-commit sync is dominated by Shell and Pager lifecycle, session, queue, dashboard, plan, permission, and terminal behavior. It adds ACP session resume/close operations, bounded-memory session forking, richer queue controls, permission-pattern editing, sandbox metadata, sampling retries, and multiple dashboard/Pager affordances while hardening auth, `/resume`, background-task, tmux, MCP, and teardown paths. The range heavily overlaps grok-pi's Pager/session seams, so integration must remain isolated and preserve Pi as the sole agent, session, and queue owner.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- Shell and Pager account for 463 of 577 changed files; 99 upstream paths overlap local post-`a422116` work, including 61 Pager/session/model/settings seams.
- ACP session resume/close and restored-child registration must not transfer session ownership away from Pi or make `pi-grok-adapter` stateful; upstream does not touch the fork-only adapter crate.
- Queue reordering, send-now preservation, and background-parent continuation overlap grok-pi's Pi-owned queue mirror and require focused state-machine validation.
- Pager `/resume`, dashboard, plan approval, model selection, terminal teardown, copy, and modal changes overlap native external-profile seams and should be reapplied surgically in an isolated worktree.
- Permission-path normalization, read-only Git auto-approval, sandbox metadata, MCP kill-switch enforcement, and auth changes received focused security/error-path checks. This verified isolated integration updates `SOURCE_REV` and the `AGENTS.md` base without broadening verifier allowlists; delivery to local `main` completed after explicit user authorization, with no remote push.

## [a422116] — 2026-08-01

- **Diff size:** 165 files changed, +15161 / −1969

### Summary

This sync is a broad runtime reliability and lifecycle update across Pager, Shell, tools, workspace, and Computer Hub. It adds session/task cleanup, configurable wait caps, context-overflow recognition, overload retries, compaction continuity, background-task reminders, and safer PTY/auth/permission behavior. Pager app/event-loop/session/dashboard changes and Shell agent/session/compaction changes overlap grok-pi integration seams, so the merge must be performed in an isolated worktree and validated without transferring ownership from Pi.

### Added

- Add background-subagent completion reminders with a selectable delivery surface.

### Changed

- Release a shell session's resources in one drop.
- Make the tools blocking-wait cap client-configurable and self-describing.
- Carry running background tasks and subagents across compaction.
- Require round-trip time for SDK liveness checks.
- Consume the attached-client signal and report why idle is withheld.
- Release a session's activity record when the session ends.
- Scope skills watches on project vendor roots.
- Make the leader soak measure the leader, not its harness.
- Delete sessions from the dashboard and welcome list.

### Fixed

- Recognize API "exceeds budget" errors as context overflow.
- Retry /btw on model overload.
- Make a PTY shell reap itself until it reaches the registry.
- Recover the OS error code from a TLS-phase connection reset.
- Treat `.grok/sandbox.toml` edits as protected so auto mode prompts before writing.
- Surface history/search in the Ctrl+. cheatsheet and keep it working in history view.
- Stop charging auth-retry budget for fail-closed 401s; reset it across suspends.
- Make [stop] cancel in-flight compaction.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- The 55 Pager and 58 Shell files include the highest-risk `app/`, event-loop, session, dashboard, auth, compaction, PTY, and task-lifecycle paths; `pi-grok-adapter` remains untouched and must stay headless.
- Ten upstream-touched files overlap local post-`dd04f39` work: `app/actions.rs`, `app/agent_view/{mod,render,session}.rs`, `app/app_view.rs`, `app/dispatch/router.rs`, `app/dispatch/session/lifecycle.rs`, `app/effects/{helpers,mod}.rs`, and `Cargo.lock`.
- Session cleanup, background-task/subagent continuity, and compaction changes must preserve Pi as the sole agent/session owner and keep Grok Pager as the only visible TUI.
- Permission, sandbox, auth, and TLS changes require focused security/error-path checks; `SOURCE_REV`, the prior changelog status, and verifier metadata should only be closed after a verified integration.

- **Diff size:** 618 files changed, +55053 / −18012

### Summary

This five-commit sync is dominated by Shell and Pager lifecycle, headless ACP, task/process cleanup, sampling/compaction, and tool-runtime work. It bounds large-session and fork memory, reclaims session-owned child resources, adds ACP session listing and background-task/tool streaming, improves startup and terminal-resize resilience, and expands security, certificate, dashboard, and telemetry behavior. The range overlaps 102 fork-modified files, including Grok-Pi's highest-risk Pager `app/`, external ACP/session, plan/settings, queue/subagent, model/sampling, headless, and event-loop seams.

### Changed

- Bound peak memory while loading large sessions and stream inherited replay to bound fork memory.
- Show the UI immediately while fetching models and settings in the background.
- Copy the complete approved plan with `y`, keep the whole plan in scrollback, and separate reasoning from output in minimal mode.
- Make workspace task snapshots list only incomplete background tasks.
- Run plan-mode exit last in mixed tool batches.
- Reclaim retained/resident session state and session-owned processes, LSP servers, MCP children, subagents, Bash/background commands, and hook children when a session closes.
- Inherit the parent session process scope into subagents, cancel all session subagents when the user stops, and let session persistence exit when its session ends.
- Build the `@` file-search matcher lazily and cap Shell/Workspace Tokio workers on many-core hosts.
- Reuse spawn-time skill discovery for session telemetry.
- Mark `/gboom` as non-production code and quiet routine auth, LSP, and config warnings.
- Cache growing transcripts on the messages backend.
- Tell the model when a wait was clamped instead of re-inviting it.
- Deliver the stationarity nudge after the tool result and stop claiming results are identical.
- Run auth-provider commands through the platform shell.
- Keep monitor-tool stdout short and prescriptive.
- Use UUIDs for analytics event insert IDs.
- Allow deleting the current session from within that session.
- Enable doom-loop recovery by default.
- Kill agent children and the idle inhibitor when the parent process dies.
- Temporarily disable TUI session-share link creation.
- Split the headless Pager module into clearer submodules.
- Use the compaction sampler tokenizer for item token counts.
- Make fullscreen terminal resize substantially cheaper for long sessions.
- Hide `/usage` for external-auth deployments.
- Declare slash-command screen-mode support in one place.
- Keep settings enum pickers on the committed value until Enter.
- Give each sampling backend its own conversion module.
- Suppress the cancelled marker on send-now wake turns.

### Fixed

- Prevent armed signature verification from deleting the managed-deny smoke policy.
- Correct observability attributes for warm-store errors, restore setup, remote tools, and preview denials.
- Security: apply the sandbox profile to the leader process that executes tools.
- Withhold key-event types from affected Alacritty builds that otherwise double keys.
- Degrade `@` file search instead of aborting when thread creation is exhausted.
- Correct contradictions and defects in tool descriptions, schemas, outputs, and harness pools.
- Stop leaking shell-wrapper positional parameters into sourced scripts, including persistent/static-shell Conda activation.
- Self-heal a corrupt session-search SQLite cache.
- Capture `SIGABRT` so panic-aborts leave crash reports.
- Stop crashing at startup when the host cannot create more threads.
- Fail open the access gate to avoid false CLI paywalls.
- Fix multi-process credential wipes and orphaned session log writers.

- Treat an unenrolled child process as a lint error.

### Removed / Deprecated

- Remove the ineffective no-op tool reminder.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- Pager and Shell account for 397 changed files; 102 paths overlap fork modifications across `app/`, settings/model startup, plan/review scrollback, queue/subagent/session lifecycle, external ACP, headless, and event-loop seams.
- The headless module split plus ACP `session/list`, tool-call streaming, and gateway-task lifecycle must preserve Pi as the only agent/session owner and keep `pi-grok-adapter` headless.
- Upstream Herdr detection must be reconciled with the fork's existing Herdr integration rather than replacing product-specific behavior.
- Session-close and parent-death reclamation spans Tools, MCP, PTYs, hooks, subprocess scope, LSP, persistence, and subagents; Pi child-session ownership and adapter lifecycle must remain intact.
- Sampling and compaction refactors overlap Grok-Pi model/thinking/context projection and require focused adapter plus Pager validation.
- Conflict resolution must happen in an isolated integration worktree before any verified result is delivered to local `main`; no remote push is part of this recording step.

## [47348d1] — 2026-07-26

> **Status:** Merged into local `main` by ff-only delivery (two-parent upstream merge `be91fe7`); 64-path concurrent WIP restored unstaged from verified safety tip `3d4278d`.

- **Diff size:** 138 files changed, +7283 / −5796

### Summary

This sync is dominated by Pager and Shell reliability changes plus workspace-security, managed-config signing, and hook configuration updates. It makes startup/runtime failures recoverable, preserves completed terminal output across gateway loss, tightens workspace file confinement and hook-root approval boundaries, and changes lifecycle behavior around session termination. Pager `app/`, session visibility, inline/freeform input, task output, hooks, config paths, and external-agent integration are high-risk Pi-Grok seam areas and must be merged in isolation.

### Areas touched

| Area | Files | +/− | Added / Deleted | Notes |
|------|------:|----:|-----------------|-------|
| Shell (agent runtime) | 30 | +1891/−2608 | 5/1 | recoverable HTTP/runtime/session failures and terminal transport behavior |

| Update / Version | 1 | +1/−1 | 0/0 | version metadata |
| **Total** | **138** | **+7283/−5796** | **8/1** | |

### Added

- Raise the Linux file-descriptor soft limit and log effective limits at startup.
- Embed the deployment-config signing public key.
- Parse hooks from configuration files.
- Add a remote kill-switch for managed-config signature verification.

### Changed

- Keep completed terminal output when the gateway connection is lost.
- Show duration-only detail for single-task task output.
- Prevent a stale registry turn counter from hiding local sessions.
- Make HTTP client construction failures non-fatal.
- Make session-thread and runtime-spawn failures recoverable.
- Fire `SessionEnd` hooks on `/exit` and headless quit.

### Fixed

- Report invalid MCP server configuration instead of failing startup.
- Restore main-prompt paste parity in the question freeform input.
- Repaint paste-chip backgrounds on inline panel inputs.
- Security: prevent `acceptEdits` from auto-approving writes into the always-trusted global hook root.
- Render stacked “Worked for” markers correctly so parks appear as status and turns close with exactly one marker.
- Security: keep workspace file-reference resolution inside workspace filesystem confinement.

### Integration result

- Preserved upstream ancestry in two-parent merge commit `be91fe7` after resolving five conflicts by combining upstream lock/security/lifecycle semantics with Pi-Grok settings, model-picker and external-agent seams.
- Preserved Pi-owned queue/session/tree/trust/tools/extensions behavior, `OpenPiConfig`, `DirectPi`, F2 settings (including Pi built-in tools and grouped recap/BtW model slots), `.grok-pi` product isolation, and the locked `pi-main` gitlink `a5afc3f`.
- Restored omitted upstream lifecycle/test infrastructure during semantic audit: external ACP `agent_thread`, PTY timeout/EOF pump semantics, and `workspace.tasks_snapshot` dispatch.
- Passed adapter tests (128), serial `grok-pi` binary tests (56), config tests (184), isolated-home Workspace tests (1560 library + 21 server), settings-modal tests (173; 1 ignored), two focused Pager contract tests, `cargo check`, and `./build.sh`.
- Added a repository-managed Cargo cache at `<git-common-dir>/pi-grok-cargo-target`; all linked worktrees share the same generated artifacts via ignored `target` symlinks. The migration and wrapper were tested in a temporary multi-worktree repository and on all current worktrees.
- Remaining failures are separated from merge regressions: one Hooks DNS test reproduces before the merge because this machine resolves `.invalid` to an internal address; Python tree-sitter packages are absent; source/renderer hash manifests, slash `fork`/`voice` rules, and one mock completion-barrier expectation were already stale and were not weakened or regenerated blindly.
- Delivery was ff-only from local `main` `906470c` to integration base `1a52f81`; the final closeout documentation commit is layered on that history while the restored WIP remains uncommitted. Post-restore Herdr Node/Rust, Pi-model, cargo-check, and help-smoke checks passed with zero manifest mismatches.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- Pager changes span 69 files and overlap Pi-Grok `app/`, modal/input, task-output, session and external-profile seams.
- Hook/config changes must preserve `.grok-pi` product isolation and `project_config_dir()` routing while absorbing upstream security fixes.
- Runtime recovery and gateway-loss behavior must not transfer agent/session ownership away from Pi or make the adapter stateful/UI-owning.
- Managed-config signing changes may alter verifier baselines and root metadata; `SOURCE_REV`, `AGENTS.md` base and baselines change only after a verified merge.

### Summary

Large sync dominated by Pager and Shell changes: title-based resume, queue editing, tutorial and privacy surfaces, auth/provider hardening, true-noop turn handling, workflow recovery, and expanded tool/workspace behavior. Pager `app/`, session, queue, voice, settings, workflow overlay, and Shell ACP/auth paths overlap heavily with Pi-Grok integration seams, so the merge must remain isolated and preserve the fork's external-agent and Pi-owned runtime boundaries.

### Added

- ACP terminal output recorder
- Cross-platform provider-auth commands in the Shell
- Custom provider gateways and subprocess-environment policy in the Shell
- `/tutorial`, an opt-in Grok Build onboarding tour
- Soft and required CLI version checks in the Shell
- Remote flag to override the image-edit model
- Edit control on queued prompt rows
- Setting to disable the Ctrl+Space/F8 voice shortcut
- Privacy upsell banner in agent view until acted on
- Tools-server client callback surface
- Documentation for marketplaces, plugins, and organization controls
- Chat API fields for deploy archive, taken-down, limit, and in-progress reasons
- Chat-supplied per-session turn index in turn hooks

- Gateway bridge lifecycle telemetry

### Changed

- Default `/resume` to Grok sessions and show a hint for hidden external sessions
- Resume sessions by title with `--resume`
- Limit app-builder archive size
- Drive slash-command tag labels from data
- Surface Grok Computer media-generation results as file-path chunks
- Stamp session ID on image-generation direct-to-API requests
- Make auto mode consider recent user intent
- Show Bash mode chrome in minimal mode
- Include voice interim text on prompt submission
- Silently end a turn on true-noop thrash
- Quiet the copy toast when clipboard delivery is confirmed
- Make the idle “still running” watcher cue open the tasks pane
- Default the web-search model to Grok 4.5
- Let plugin subagents inherit parent MCP servers
- Gate the no-op end-turn reminder on system reminders
- Allow editing finalized text while voice is open
- Relocate the token carrier to turn-commit events and plumb per-turn origin context
- Raise workflow scratch quotas and make failed runs resumable
- Auto-progress workflow-overlay phases, show live agent status, and remove the budget meter

### Fixed

- Report workspace-server `/ready` failure with dwell when hub connection fails
- Refresh the Grok agent OIDC token in the Shell
- Fix tmux issues through Doctor remediation
- Preserve privacy-banner environment overrides across live settings updates
- Return auth-info profile fields even when the access token is expired
- Keep fail-closed behavior when clearing orphans with no team
- Pass `--raw` to `pw-record` for Linux dictation on older PipeWire
- Validate Git URLs when adding marketplace entries
- Stop shipping stale tool-doc parameter and tool names
- Re-point dashboard attach after `/fork` only when the parent was attached
- Clear the web background-task tray on kill while retaining the task description
- Protect persistent global hook sources
- Refresh tool search when the managed MCP catalog is re-fetched
- Prevent duplicate leader-process spawn and startup hangs from stale leaders
- Correct auto-mode blocked documentation
- Enforce a fail-closed auth-refresh contract for Shell clients
- Fix session forks truncating at the wrong prompt in rewound sessions

### Integration result

- Resolved 16 conflicts in an isolated worktree and preserved upstream ancestry in two-parent merge commit `963ccf5`.
- Preserved Pi-owned workflow spawning, external-agent routing, product-isolated paths, Pi session/tree/queue/settings, DirectPi effects and `pi_update`; adapted upstream mailbox, voice, tutorial, privacy, slash-tag and send-now contracts.
- Passed adapter tests (128), serial `grok-pi` binary tests (56), `cargo check`, and `./build.sh`.
- Remaining source/renderer/slash/mock verifier failures reproduce unchanged on pre-merge `main`; allowlists were not broadened. Workflow focused tests are 73/74 with the known macOS `/var` canonical-path assertion failure.

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- Upstream changes heavily overlap `xai-grok-pager/src/app/`, including session lifecycle, queue editing, settings, voice, workflow overlay, event loop, actions, effects, mouse handling, and task results.
- Preserve Pi-Grok seams: `external_agent` routing, Pi-owned queue/session/trust behavior, OpenPiConfig and product-isolated paths, DirectPi effects/results, model-picker guards, and native Pager-only rendering.
- Shell auth/workflow changes are upstream-owned and should normally take upstream behavior; do not let them pull Grok runtime ownership into `pi-grok-adapter`.
- Update `SOURCE_REV`, `AGENTS.md` base, and source-identity/renderer baselines only after the isolated merge is resolved and verified.

## [a5727c5] — 2026-07-23

> **Status:** Merged into grok-pi `main` via `sync/upstream-a5727c5` @ `4d19f00` (ff-only).

- **Sync range:** `3af4d5d..a5727c5` (`3af4d5d39897855bdcc74f23e690024a5dc05573` → `a5727c5960452e7527a154b25cb5bf00cda0545e`)
- **Upstream commits:** 1 (`Synced from monorepo`)
- **SOURCE_REV (monorepo SHA):** `30192d2eef5d91a8fff0e53957de5bd05b43398c` (was `0f4d7c91b8b2b408333f6de1e8a76cb8eaa71899`)
- **Diff size:** 482 files changed, +37627 / −13402

### Summary

Medium-large monorepo sync focused on **Doctor remediation consolidation**, **auto-mode classifier / permission gate behavior**, **marketplace reliability**, **working-directory relocation recovery**, and broad **Pager UX** (Esc cancel, queue edit newlines, permission auto-focus, dashboard hit targets). Shell/runtime and workspace permission crates dominate the +/−; Pager `app/` and `dispatch/` remain high-risk seam surfaces for grok-pi.

### Areas touched

| Area | Files | +/− | Added / Deleted | Notes |
|------|------:|----:|-----------------|-------|
| Shell (agent runtime) | 136 | +13903/−6593 | 3/0 | relocation recovery, doctor, toolOverrides, workflows default-on |
| Pager (TUI) | 234 | +11313/−3749 | 1/0 | Esc cancel, queue edit, dashboard, session-info, doctor UI |

| **Total** | **482** | **+37627/−13402** | **12/1** | |

### Added

- Non-blocking coding-data sharing upsell banner
- `toolOverrides` wire types and session/agent wiring
- Out-of-process macOS mic capture
- Shared test process lifecycle and shared test sandbox
- Relocation transaction state machine
- Privacy notice rollout flag
- One-shot occurrence journal persistence
- Durable scheduler expiry persistence
- Document `[feedback.user]` author identity config

### Changed

- Consolidate remediation in Doctor; apply doctor fixes in the TUI; route startup warnings to doctor
- Auto mode defers fail-closed gate asks to the classifier; classifier honors recorded approvals; timeouts prompt instead of silent deny
- Marketplace: coalesce list fetches; remove source by name; contain hung git sources (timeouts, non-blocking refresh, unbrick modal)
- Report real exit codes for completed background shells
- Narrow the date-rollover reminder to date-bearing templates
- Split prompt-trigger telemetry and record classifier provenance
- Raise connectors-manager timeout to 60s
- Scope subagent completion drains to the owning session
- Set `client_identifier=grok-agent-sdk`
- Accept both spellings of the workspace-teleport kill switch
- Stop turns that poll the exact same tool call 16× in a row
- Copy compaction checkpoint files when forking sessions
- Auto-focus permission prompt from scrollback
- Esc cancels the running turn in non-vim and minimal modes
- List Ctrl+Z undo and redo in keyboard shortcuts
- Show active auth mode on session-info
- Install the npm binary under `$GROK_HOME`
- Shift/Alt+Enter inserts newline when editing a queued prompt
- Gate project Claude permissions on folder trust
- Echo `response.create.event_id` on `response.created`
- Toast when session creation fails from disk full
- Enable dynamic workflows by default
- Integrate relocation recovery
- Confirm before removing extensions-modal items
- Re-run compact and prompt after login when compact hit expired auth
- Recap sends hosted tools under backend search
- Extend bang command timeout
- Label failed workspace RPCs with `error_kind`
- Drop redundant explicit tonic/prost deps from `xai-grok-shell`

### Fixed

- Security: Bash(`git:*`) allowlist matches whole command chain by prefix
- Close combine-queued edit-hold race
- Break harness discovery ref cycle so connections can idle-evict
- Remove hover/click dead zones between dashboard items
- Surface auth failures on model-switch compact

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- **Do not merge on `main`.** A trial `git merge upstream/main` produced **48 unmerged paths** and was aborted; use an isolated worktree/branch.
- High seam overlap: `xai-grok-pager/src/app/` (69 files, +5675/−1761), `dispatch/` (+2208/−481), `acp/tracker`, `event_loop`, `slash/`, `pager-bin/src/main.rs`.
- Permission/auto-mode and queue-edit changes may interact with Pi queue mirror + External profile intercepts — reapply narrow Pi-Grok seams after taking upstream core logic.
- `SOURCE_REV` / `AGENTS.md` base updated on merge-back (`30192d2e…` / `a5727c5`). Source-identity baselines may still need a deliberate regen if verifiers fail.
- Pi-Grok-only crates (`pi-grok-adapter`, `extensions/`) are not in this upstream range.


## [3af4d5d] — 2026-07-22

> **Status:** Merged into grok-pi (branch `sync/upstream-3af4d5d` @ `a5ffbcb`, pending merge back to `main`).

- **Sync range:** `a881e67..3af4d5d` (`a881e6703f46b01d8c7d4a5437683546df30449d` → `3af4d5d39897855bdcc74f23e690024a5dc05573`)

- **Diff size:** 556 files changed, +56609 / −21892

### Summary

Large monorepo sync dominated by a brand-new **workflow engine** crate
(`xai-workflow`), a major **permission/security overhaul** in
`xai-grok-workspace` (exec-risk scoring, auto-mode, hardened shell access), and
extensive **Shell** and **Pager** changes (working-directory relocation, model
providers, doctor diagnostics, prompt-queue batching). Multiple security fixes
close RCE and credential-plugin attack vectors.

- Pager: centralize terminal diagnostics and probes
- Pager: standardize backgrounding on Ctrl+B
- Chat: select App Builder product on the Build path
- Sandbox: apply Landlock without a controlling TTY

### Merge risk for grok-pi

- **High:** `xai-grok-workspace/permission/` — exec-risk scoring, auto-mode, and shell-access hardening overlap with Pi-Grok's bash tool bridging and trust model. Review carefully during merge.
- **High:** `xai-grok-shell` (167 files, +19642/−16719) — massive churn in the agent runtime; relocation primitives, model providers, and reasoning tiers may shift APIs the adapter depends on.
- **Medium:** `xai-grok-pager` (266 files) — doctor, prompt combine, external editor, and diagnostics touch Pager surfaces that Pi-Grok maps to native components.
- **Low:** `xai-workflow` is a new isolated crate; `xai-prompt-queue/combine` is additive; voice/config changes are self-contained.
